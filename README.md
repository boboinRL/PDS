# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes in individuals based on specific health measurements. Using various algorithms, we analyze historical data and create models to predict the risk of diabetes.

## Objectives
- To gather and preprocess a dataset related to diabetes.
- To implement various machine learning algorithms for prediction.
- To evaluate the performance of these algorithms using appropriate metrics.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for predictions.

## Dataset
The data used in this project is sourced from various health-related databases.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
We explore several algorithms, including but not limited to:
- Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
Performance of the models is evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Curve

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the provided scripts to train the models.
4. Use the trained model for predictions.

## Conclusion
Through effective data analysis and model training, we aim to provide a reliable diabetes prediction tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention strategies.
